### **2. Payment Details Section Implementation**

<div className="flex items-center space-x-2">
  <svg className="w-4 h-4 text-gray-500" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
    <path strokeLinecap="round" strokeLinejoin="round" strokeWidth={2} d="M3 10h18M7 15h1m4 0h1m-7 4h12a3 3 0 003-3V8a3 3 0 00-3-3H6a3 3 0 00-3 3v8a3 3 0 003 3z" />
  </svg>
  <span className="text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
    ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ {trip.payment_method_id.slice(-4)}
  </span>
</div>
```

#### **Pay Now Button Functionality**
```javascript
// Added handlePayNow function to process payments
const handlePayNow = async (tripId) => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/stripe/charge-payment', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ tripId }),
  });
  
  const result = await response.json();
  
  if (response.ok && result.success) {
    // Update trip status to paid_in_progress
    setTrips(updatedTrips);
    alert('Payment processed successfully!');
  }
};
```

### **3. Payment API Enhancement**

```javascript
// Updated trip status change logic
const { error: updateError } = await supabase
  .from('trips')
  .update({
    status: 'paid_in_progress', // Changed from just updating payment_status
    payment_status: 'paid',
    payment_intent_id: paymentIntent.id,
    charged_at: new Date().toISOString(),
    payment_amount: trip.price
  })
  .eq('id', tripId);
```
